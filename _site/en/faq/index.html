<p><b>Why should we help at all?</b></p>

<p>Lale is about helping. It is about helping us all.</p>

<p>In a world which gets increasingly interconnected, the problem that someone else has today may soon become my own problem. By helping others I also solve possible problems I may face in the future.</p>

<p>Helping refugees is first of all a humanitarian duty. As soon as you advocate for a lifestyle free from barbarity and suppression you want to live in a humane society. Helping others in your local environment will have effects elsewhere on the globe. Giving shelter and food in your town to refugees mistreated and expelled from their homes due to wars may give them the necessary energy to free their homeland from war. Then they can return to rebuild their countries, farm their home land and start trade with your local business which will raise prosperity for both sides.</p>

<p>By helping others we are helping ourselves. We are all interconnected.</p>

<p><b>Why do we need Lale for helping others?</b></p>

<p>Information Technology allows new efficient ways to communicate and work with one another. By utilizing information technology a crowd could be more efficient, more agile, faster and even at times more intelligent than a rigid organization.</p>

<p>Lale wants to harness information technology to multiply the work of a single helper and the work of helper organizations. Helping is a process with several steps. The actual help are often very small efforts such as taking care of children for one hour, translating a CV into local language or repairing a flat bicycle tire. But it takes a great amount of energy and effort to organize the help itself until someone can directly support an individual in need.  Let the helpers do all the help and let Lale care about organizing the help. So that there is more time for direct personal help to people and minimal time spent for administration.</p>

<p><b>How did we come to make Lale?</b></p>

<p>While on sabbatical leave in 2015, Lale founder Ralf Schroeder was looking for ways to engage more directly with his local community. As the increasing crisis of refugees in Europe changed from a remote and abstract problem to a local and immediate call for help, it seemed like a perfect cause to engage. Luckily, there was already a well run helper circle in place in his village of Kirchheim. After taking on a few tasks, it quickly became apparent that the organization of volunteer help was complex and inefficient leading to less help reaching the refugees and even helper frustration and fatigue. Clearly not a long term solution.</p>

<p>At the same time Ralf and Matze Walz were working on a publication analyzing the potential of open-source collaboration, internet platforms, circular economy, sharing economy and peer-to-peer systems to drive towards a design and development process for sustainable green products. In the spirit of an ‘economy of the common good’, as envisioned by Christian Felber and others, it seemed that generating short-term profit for investors while violating common good of the society as a whole is a fatal direction to pursue.</p>

<p>Non-profit work, provided laterally between peers in society, can take on a much larger role in addressing our needs. What is missing is a complete and working system to connect the capacity to help with the need of being helped. And the power of the internet connecting us all is the critical enabler for it. This will be true for emerging forms of lateral economies, but most importantly also for humanitarian help required right now in the refugee crisis.</p>

<p>This is why we set out to build Lale. A platform that matches up the desire and capacity to help with exactly where help is needed. For the good of us all.</p>

<p><b>How is Lale financed?</b></p>

<p>There is no commercial or political organization behind Lale, it is independent. The Lale gGmbH is a non-profit organization by law and it is 100% owned by its founders. It was financed with private savings. Instead of investing in financial markets or real estate, we consider it a more valuable usage of money to finance a platform which organizes help in such an efficient way that more and more people all over the world will help each other.</p>

<p>Lale needs the means to run the technical platform, which includes programming of new features, hosting costs, communication costs and general administrative expenses in order to operate Lale according to highest professional standards and transparency.</p>

<p>Lale needs to be a long-term, sustainable effort. We plan Lale to be solidly financed by charitable donations and the user community itself. As we offer services that are costly to operate, we will require appropriate usage fees to cover the cost. Also, we will rely on voluntary donations by users to allow Lale to prosper. All potential surplus will go to supporting refugees as outlined in our founding documents.</p>

<p><b>Why is Lale called “Lale”?</b></p>

<p>Lale (pronounced Laa-LEY), is a girls name in the Persian language. It means “tulip” and this is represented in our logo. Lale was also the name of an infant girl in one of the refugee camps in Germany. Just 5 months old, she couldn’t possibly comprehend the future that lies ahead of her.</p>

<p>Lale stands as a symbol for all children refugees affected by the current crisis. The tulip stands as a symbol of hope for these innocent human beings to enjoy a better future.</p>

<p><b>How does Lale handle my personal data?</b></p>

<p>Data privacy is very important to Lale. We only capture data that is directly relevant to the process of coordinating help and required by the platform to function. We have written this down in more in detail in data privacy statement and you can always contact us at info@lale.help with any questions.</p>

<p>Lale is a platform and uses hosting services in Europe for processing and storing any data.
What technology does Lale use?</p>

<p>Lale is open source so you can always review our code yourself. In fact, if you are a developer we would be excited to have you join our project at https://github.com/lale-help and https://lale.slack.com.</p>

<p>Lale.help is built as a Ruby on Rails application, hosted at heroku. We are using heroku’s postgres database for application data and amazon’s S3 storage for filedata. The heroku instance are deployed in the European region. The Lale.help website is build on jekyll and hosted on github directly. We are also looking for creative minds to join our website effort.</p>
