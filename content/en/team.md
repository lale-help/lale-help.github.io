<b>Our Mission</b>

The European refugee crisis is the largest socio-economic challenge in decades and the true test of our shared humanitarian values as Europeans. Long-term, sustainable solutions need to be carried by a majority of citizens and lead to durable support and meaningful integration of displaced people until they can safely return to their home countries. 

Laleâ€™s mission is to organize the coordination, communication and execution of hands-on help by volunteers in local helper circles. We aim to simplify the management of volunteer groups and to engage as many individuals as possible in the act of helping others. If everyone helps just once, we can build bridges that lead to human connections and true integration.


<b>Our Values</b>

We are non-profit. Lale operates with the simple human goal of increasing and sustaining help for refugees in Europe. Our service is free of charge, all donations will be used to support the Lale project.

We are open. Lale is built by global IT volunteers and anyone can join this development project and contribute to it as open-source.

We are collaborative. Lale applies new ideas of the collaborative economy by connecting individuals efficiently to support refugees. Capacity to help is brought to the right place and time in an autonomous, decentralized way.

We are aspirational. Lale operates as a platform for coordination, communication and trust so that the sum of individual efforts can make a big difference for refugees and change the world.

We are compassionate. Lale is a humanitarian effort to support refugees in need, regardless of race, color and creed.

We are global and local. Lale is a global platform for volunteers all over the world that enables autonomous self-organization for local helper groups.
