The European refugee crisis is the largest socio-economic challenge in decades and the true test of our shared humanitarian values as Europeans. Long-term, sustainable solutions need to be carried by a majority of citizens and lead to durable support and meaningful integration of displaced people until they can safely return to their home countries. 

Laleâ€™s mission is to organize the coordination, communication and execution of hands-on help by volunteers in local helper circles. We aim to simplify the management of volunteer groups and to engage as many individuals as possible in the act of helping others. If everyone helps just once, we can build bridges that lead to human connections and true integration.

We are a team based in the US and Germany that is working hard to build a free platform to support volunteers in their efforts to help refugees all over Europe.
